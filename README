BlocksworldAstar is the executable created when running the makefile. It only takes one command-line argument and that would be a test file. The command should look like:
./BlocksworldAstar BWCHP/bwchp01.bwp
MAX_ITERS is set to 100000 meaning it will try 100000 iterations before returning a failure message.
